In recent years, I've made a habit of attending gigs for artists I enjoy. Financially this provides me a way to support them (as I'm a filthy Spotify user, so very few royalties end up their way), and I'll often pick up merch at the same time. I honestly haven't done the maths on how many band t-shirts I currently own, but it's a large proportion of my wardrobe. Sometimes I even manage to have a small chat to the artist at the end of the gig!

I thought it could be interesting to share my experiences at each, and if nothing else you can get a good idea of music I listen to - maybe you'll find something you like!

February in particular I went to 7 gigs, which is almost certainly a personal record. It seems that many artists stop touring in the winter months, and then tour Europe in the early spring, presumably then touring the US later in the year.

This was a really cool gig to kick the year off with. Britten Sinfonia was conducted by Suzie Collier (Jacob Collier's mother!), and featured some other musicians I wasn't familiar with. I'm actually a bigger fan of Chris Thile than I am of Jacob Collier (of whom I admire greatly), so seeing the two of them together was a great experience.

The first half of the gig was a lot more classical than I was perhaps expecting, but I enjoyed the orchestra's rendition of the very rhythmic "Nautilus" by Anna Meredith, and a very Latin "Danzon No. 2" by Arturo Marquez. Two students (Danushka Edirisinghe & Finn Anderson-Hendra) from the Royal Academy of Music (where Suzie Collier teaches) also featured in a cello duet.

Jacob also showed off his vocal prowess by _singing_ his half of Bach's "Vivace from Concerto in D Minor", accompanied by Chris on his trusty mandolin.

The second half was more what I expected - a selection of songs from both Jacob and Chris' careers. Personal highlights for me were Chris' "Julep" and "My Oh My", and Jacob's "Little Blue" and "Summer Rain". There was also plenty of time for noodling around, and moments where Jacob and Chris had clearly decided to go off on an adventure - we were more than happy to be brought along for the ride!

Due to the size of the gig, there sadly wasn't a chance to catch either musician after the show (and I didn't buy any merch) but it was still an awesome time and I'm glad I went.
