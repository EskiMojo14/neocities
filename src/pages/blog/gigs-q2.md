Continuing on from my [previous post](/blog/gigs-q1), here are the concerts I attended in the second quarter of 2025. I'll expand this as time goes on, but for now I'll just list the ones I've already been to.

### Fox Stevenson

Quite literally a bucket list item for me! I've listened to Fox since I was about 13, around the release of his Endless EP. I'd never seen him live before, as most of his gigs were solely DJ sets. This time around he had a live band, so I was really looking forward to it.

The opening act was Yue, a singer/producer (and Fox's girlfriend), who performed a DJ set. I cannot claim to understand the art of DJing, but it looked like she had a lot of fun and the crowd had a blast. Some of my favourites were drum and bass remixes of the classic "Mas Que Nada" and KATSEYE's "Touch", but she also mixed in a few of her own tracks.

Fox then had his live set, which was amazing! He sung, and was accompanied by Pat Lundy on drums and his long-time friend Bustre (Bruce Charles) on guitar (along with the usual backing tracks). The crowd (myself included) was incredibly loud the entire concert, and Fox posted on his Instagram story that it was the best gig he'd ever played.

Some of my favourites were some tracks from his upcoming EP, "Exile Is A Habit", "Curtain Call" and "That Choice". An older track "Bruises" was also a lot of fun. I will admit I was a little disappointed there weren't any throwbacks further than 2018, but that was about the time where his music gained more rock influences so it makes sense.

Fox ended his live set at around 10pm, and had a DJ set after. Unfortunately I had a long travel the day after, so I decided to give the DJ set a miss - I'm sure it was great, but the live band was mainly why I had made the trip in the first place.

### Tom McGuire & The Brassholes

Finally a local gig! I wasn't super familiar with the band until recently, but some persistent advertising and Spotify discovery tipped me off to them. I'm really glad I decided to check them out, because the concert was so much fun!

The starting act were a local ska fusion band, Technicolour Steam Train. The members seemed quite young, but very talented - plenty of shenanigans too, such as a slide whistle solo in a song about ghosts. We had a good time joining in chants about missing hash browns, and making ghost wails.

Tom McGuire & The Brassholes then took the stage, and it was an awesome time! Tom is a great showman, and did a few trips through the audience mid-song while playing a guitar solo. His band were very impressive - I was stood by the horn section, but got an occasional good view of his bassist and keyboardist (who did his best dance break during one song). Track-wise, I had some favourites from his upcoming album, and a few from previous albums.

After the show I headed to the merch table, and had a brief chat with Tom while picking up a t-shirt. I also signed up for their mailing list, so I'm looking forward to their next album!

### Choir! Choir! Choir!

A very different gig this time! This was essentially a sing-a-long, with two guys (Daveed Goldman and Nobu Adilman) leading the audience as a choir. They entered to "Girls Just Want to Have Fun", and then we sang a few well known songs - "Big Yellow Taxi", "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)", and "Can't Help Falling in Love" to name a few.

We then reached the main objective of the gig - learning Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah". We were split into two halves, and took turns singing harmony or melody. In the verses, my group sang harmony and then swapped to melody for the chorus.

Overall it was a great time! Daveed and Nobu both did a great job leading us, and almost had a "good cop, bad cop" routine going on. Lots of laughs all round.
