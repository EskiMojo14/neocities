Continuing on from my [previous post](/blog/gigs-q1), here are the concerts I attended in the second quarter of 2025. I'll expand this as time goes on, but for now I'll just list the ones I've already been to.

Quite literally a bucket list item for me! I've listened to Fox since I was about 13, around the release of his Endless EP. I'd never seen him live before, as most of his gigs were solely DJ sets. This time around he had a live band, so I was really looking forward to it.

The opening act was Yue, a singer/producer (and Fox's girlfriend), who performed a DJ set. I cannot claim to understand the art of DJing, but it looked like she had a lot of fun and the crowd had a blast. Some of my favourites were drum and bass remixes of the classic "Mas Que Nada" and KATSEYE's "Touch", but she also mixed in a few of her own tracks.

Fox then had his live set, which was amazing! He sung, and was accompanied by Pat Lundy on drums and his long-time friend Bustre (Bruce Charles) on guitar (along with the usual backing tracks).
